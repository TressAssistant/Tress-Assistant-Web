Tress Assistant values your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information.

#### Data Collection and Use

Tress Assistant is a frontend-only app. We do **not** collect or upload your personal data to our servers. Your preferences and settings are stored locally in your browser using `localStorage` and never leave your device. Cookies may be used by frameworks or libraries to enhance your experience, but we do not use cookies to track you or collect personal information. With your permission, we may access your device's location to improve your experience; this data is only used locally and is not sent to us.

When you use our app, standard server logs (such as IP address, browser type, and access times) may be generated for security and maintenance. These logs are not linked to your identity.

We do **not** share your personal information with third parties. However, the server provider may collect standard logs as part of their service. The libraries used in this software may also collect information as described in their respective privacy policies. For more information, please refer to their privacy policy.

You can clear your preferences at any time by clearing your browser's local storage and cookies, and you can control location access through your browser settings.

#### Your Rights and Choices

You may access, update, or delete your information stored in your browser at any time. If you have questions or concerns about your privacy, please contact us through the app's support channels.

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in the app.
